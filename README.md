# Pivot

A simple chrome extension I'm working on.
The app is meant to help students get a centralised place to manage your grades and assignments with a easy to navigate popup. So far the only supported applications are canvas and synergy.

I'm planning to try and publish v1 on teh chrome web store by the end of June. V1 will have pretty limited features (auto fill info, links, maybe ability to view some grades), but it will be a start and from there I can start working on better features.
